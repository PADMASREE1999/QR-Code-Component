## My process

I have used the basic template provided for the challenge and expanded it. I have divided every part into a different div block, like the QR image on one div and the content in seperate divs. Once I was done with the html content, I started working on the css by adjusting the padding, margins, fonts, color, etc. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge has helped me revise the CSS concepts related to padding and font-face.
